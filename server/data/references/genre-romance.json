      "heading": "Happily Ever After (HEA) or Happy For Now (HFN) Requirement",
      "summary": "Romance novels must end with HEA (permanent commitment) or HFN (couple together, commitment implied)",
      "content": "The defining characteristic of romance is the emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending. A romance must have either an HEA (Happily Ever After - marriage, permanent commitment, explicit future together) or HFN (Happy For Now - couple together at the end, future commitment strongly implied). The relationship must be the central plot focus, and the ending must provide emotional closure and satisfaction for the reader.",
      "ruleNumber": "R-1",
      "category": "structure",
      "section": "Core Requirements",
      "examples": [
        "HEA Example: 'Six months later, they stood at the altar, exchanging vows they'd written together.'",
        "HFN Example: 'As they drove into the sunset, her hand in his, she knew this was just the beginning.'",
        "Non-romance ending (avoid): 'They went their separate ways, forever changed by what they'd shared.' (bittersweet, not satisfying)",
        "Required elements: Couple united, obstacles overcome, mutual love declared, future implied or stated",
        "Subgenre variation: Contemporary HFN often acceptable; historical typically requires HEA",
        "The journey to HEA/HFN must feel earned through character growth and obstacle resolution"

      "heading": "Romance as Central Plot",
      "summary": "The developing romantic relationship must be the main plot, not a subplot",
      "content": "In romance, the love story is the primary narrative arc. While subplots (career, family, mystery) enhance the story, the central focus is the romantic relationship's development. Remove the romance, and the plot collapses. Both characters' emotional journeys and relationship growth drive the narrative forward.",
      "ruleNumber": "R-2",
      "category": "structure",
      "section": "Core Requirements",
      "examples": [
        "Correct focus: 'She couldn't concentrate on the merger while his words echoed in her mind: I love you.'",
        "Romance as subplot (incorrect): 'She solved the murder case. Bonus: she fell in love with her partner.'",
        "Balanced plot: External goal (save the ranch) tied to romance (working together creates intimacy)",
        "Both POVs necessary: Show how each character processes their growing feelings",
        "Page time: 60-70% of narrative should directly involve romantic relationship development",
        "Emotional stakes: Reader must care whether couple ends up together above all other plot outcomes"

      "id": "romance-pov",
      "heading": "Point of View Conventions",
      "summary": "Romance typically uses dual POV (both protagonists); third person limited or first person; present or past tense",
      "content": "Most modern romance uses dual POV, alternating between both romantic leads to show their internal thoughts and feelings. Third person limited is most common, though first person is popular in contemporary. Each POV character's voice should be distinct. Avoid head-hopping within scenes. Historical and inspirational romance sometimes use single POV (heroine only).",

      "examples": [
        "Dual POV setup: 'Chapter 1 - Emma's POV. Chapter 2 - Liam's POV.' (alternating chapters or scenes)",
        "Third limited: 'She watched him cross the room, heart racing. Did he feel it too?'",
        "First person: 'I couldn't stop staring at the way his hands moved. Get it together, Maya.'",
        "Distinct voices: Hero POV might be more reserved, heroine more emotionally aware (avoid stereotypes)",
        "Avoid: 'She felt nervous. He thought she looked beautiful.' (head-hopping in same paragraph)",

      "heading": "Emotional Interiority and Internal Monologue",
      "summary": "Romance requires deep POV showing characters' emotions, thoughts, fears, and desires",
      "content": "Readers must experience characters' emotional journeys intimately. Use internal monologue, visceral reactions, and deep POV to show vulnerability, longing, fear of intimacy, and growing love. Don't just tell emotions—show physical sensations, racing thoughts, and emotional conflict. The internal stakes (fear of heartbreak, trust issues) often drive the external plot.",

      "examples": [
        "Deep POV: 'Her pulse jumped. This is dangerous. He's dangerous—to her carefully constructed walls.'",

        "Internal conflict: 'I should walk away. Every logical part of me knows it. So why won't my feet move?'",
        "Vulnerability: 'No one had ever looked at her like that—like she mattered more than anything.'",
        "Avoid distant telling: 'She felt attracted to him.' (too clinical, not emotional)",

      "summary": "Romance dialogue carries emotional weight; subtext and tension matter more than explicit declarations",
      "content": "Dialogue in romance should crackle with tension, humor, longing, or conflict. What's unsaid often matters more than what's spoken. Characters deflect, use banter, reveal vulnerability through slips, or say the opposite of what they feel. Avoid on-the-nose emotional declarations until earned moments. Let dialogue reveal character attraction through chemistry and subtext.",

        "Banter: 'You're insufferable.' 'And yet, you're still here.' 'Biggest mistake of my life.' 'Second biggest.' (flirting disguised as arguing)",
        "Vulnerability slip: 'I don't need rescuing.' 'What if I need to be the one who—' He stopped. (reveals his feelings)",
        "Avoid: 'I am experiencing romantic feelings toward you.' (too clinical)",
        "Sexual tension: 'Cold?' he asked, stepping closer. 'No,' she lied, trembling. (proximity creates tension)",
        "Emotional reveal: 'Don't.' Her whisper was barely audible. 'Don't what?' 'Don't make me hope.'"

      "content": "Romance structure includes predictable emotional beats readers expect: (1) Meet-cute or initial attraction, (2) Growing connection despite obstacles, (3) Intimacy/vulnerability, (4) Black moment (breakup or crisis), (5) Grand gesture or realization, (6) HEA/HFN. These beats create emotional satisfaction. The black moment must feel devastating but earn the eventual reunion.",

        "Grand gesture: 'He showed up at her door, rain-soaked. I was wrong. I was terrified. But losing you terrifies me more.'",

      "content": "Tension is the lifeblood of romance. Build anticipation through near-misses, lingering glances, accidental touches, and internal awareness of attraction. The first kiss should feel earned and significant. Physical intimacy (level depends on heat rating) should parallel emotional intimacy. Avoid rushing—readers savor the journey to confession and consummation.",

        "Emotional-physical parallel: 'She'd shared her secret. Now, in the quiet aftermath, his arms around her felt inevitable.'",
        "Heat levels: Closed door (fade to black), sensual (some detail), steamy (explicit)",

      "content": "Romance conflict includes external obstacles (family disapproval, distance, career demands) and internal wounds (fear of commitment, trust issues, past trauma). The best romance blends both. Avoid 'Big Misunderstanding' plots solvable by one honest conversation. Conflicts should challenge characters' emotional growth and make the relationship feel hard-won.",

        "Avoid: 'They love each other but won't talk about it.' (frustrating, not compelling)",
        "Good conflict: 'He needs to sell the ranch to save his company. It's her childhood home. Both positions are valid.'",

      "content": "Modern romance emphasizes equality and mutual choice. Both characters pursue the relationship (even if hesitantly). Heroines demonstrate agency, making decisions about their lives and relationships. Heroes respect boundaries and communicate. Avoid old tropes: doormat heroines, controlling heroes, or relationships where one character lacks power or voice.",

      "content": "Readers must feel the spark between characters. Show chemistry through charged dialogue, magnetic pull, physical awareness (noticing details about each other), and inability to stay away despite trying. Use visceral language for attraction—racing hearts, breathlessness, electric touches. Chemistry should be present from early scenes, even if characters initially dislike each other.",

The heat level must match genre expectations and market positioning. Regardless of heat level, emotional connection matters most. Even sweet romance needs sexual tension; erotic romance still requires emotional intimacy.",

Characters check in during intimate moments, respect 'no,' and communicate wants/needs. Stalking, coercion, or ignoring boundaries are no longer romantic.
