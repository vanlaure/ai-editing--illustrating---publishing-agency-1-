      "summary": "Literary fiction employs sophisticated literary devices (metaphor, symbolism, imagery, motif, allusion) to create layered meaning beyond surface narrative. These devices should feel organic to the story, not decorative.",
      "content": "Literary fiction distinguishes itself through deliberate, skillful use of literary devices that create resonance and multiple levels of meaning. Effective use means devices emerge naturally from character, setting, and theme rather than being imposed for effect. Metaphors should illuminate rather than obscure. Symbols should accumulate meaning through repetition and context. Imagery should appeal to multiple senses and create emotional resonance. Motifs should thread through the narrative, creating unity and deepening themes. The goal is enrichment of meaning, not display of cleverness.",

Ensure readers can follow the story even as structure challenges them. Provide enough orientation (dates, headers, perspective shifts) without being heavy-handed. Unconventional structures require even tighter control of other elements; readers tolerate less confusion in language and characterization when structure is complex.

Avoid 'purple prose' (excessive ornamentation) while still achieving elevation. Read sentences aloud; they should have musicality without sacrificing sense.

Ambiguity works best with concrete details; vague writing is not the same as meaningful ambiguity. Characters can end in states of uncertainty or ongoing struggle.

      "content": "Voice is the sum total of word choice, sentence rhythm, tone, perspective, and sensibility that makes your writing recognizable. It includes what you notice, how you describe it, and the associations you make. Voice develops through practice and reading widely. Strong voice doesn't mean every sentence sounds the same—it means the whole has a consistent intelligence and sensibility behind it. Avoid tics that become mannered (same sentence structure repeatedly, overused pet words, mechanical rhythms). Voice should feel natural, not strained. First-person and close third-person allow voice to shine through character as well. Trust your natural way of seeing and describing; authentic voice trumps borrowed elevation.",
