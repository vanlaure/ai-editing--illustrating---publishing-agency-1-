Show technology in use rather than describing it. Reveal cultural differences through character interactions and conflicts. Use viewpoint character's familiarity with their world to avoid explaining obvious (to them) details. The 'iceberg principle'—show 10% of your worldbuilding, imply the other 90% exists beneath.",
